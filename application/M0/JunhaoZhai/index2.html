                I am a computer science Senior Student 4th-year student at SF state. My main hobbies focus on MMORPG and animations . 
                In the process of my learning programming, the one I came into contact with most was java. So for me, I think my Java ability is the best. In addition to Java, I have also learned C language, so my second best language is C. After I started learning artificial intelligence, python also needed attention. So my mastery of python is about 30%.
