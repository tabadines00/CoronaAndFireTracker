    <h3>Vito Gano</h3>
    <h4>Github Master/Project Manager</h4>
    <p>I’m a senior at SF State and I’m looking to graduate by Spring 2021. I was born in the Philippines but throughout most of my life, I have lived in the Bay Area. My favorite types of food are especially Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese food. In my personal free time, I really like to play online games like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, or Valorant. When I graduate, I would like to pursue entering the CS workforce in any field, however if I were to pick a specific field in the CS industry, I would like to go into gaming as it is one of my favorite pastime hobbies and my favorite activity to do!</p>

    <h3>Junhao Zhai</h3>
    <h4>Back End Developer</h4>
    <p>I am a computer science Senior Student 4th-year student at SF state. My main hobbies focus on MMORPG and animations. In the process of my learning programming, the one I came into contact with most was java. So for me, I think my Java ability is the best. In addition to Java, I have also learned C language, so my second best language is C. After I started learning artificial intelligence, python also needed attention. So my mastery of python is about 30%.
