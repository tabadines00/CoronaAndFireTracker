                Iâ€™m a 4th-year student at SF state. I tend to watch a lot of YouTube content. 
                My other pastimes I tend to see myself doing include playing rhythm games, reading translated novels or comics, sometimes doodling. I don't have professional-looking photos at the moment. The picture above are sketches I made during highschool which might give you a better idea about me.
