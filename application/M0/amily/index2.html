        Iâ€™m a 4th-year student at SF state. I tend to watch a lot of YouTube content. My other pastimes I tend to see myself doing include playing rhythm games, reading translated novels or comics, sometimes doodling. Since the Covid pandemic, I rarely find myself going outside, exploring, and doing hangouts.
